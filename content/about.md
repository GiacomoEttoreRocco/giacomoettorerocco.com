# Hi, I'm Giacomo Ettore Rocco

I was born in Udine, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy! On April 29, 1995.

I'm a data scientist with strong analytical and problem-solving skills developed in data-intensive environments. I specialize in machine learning and data visualization to support data-driven decision-making.

## Background

My passion for programming began in high school, where I combined game development with data analysis — creating virtual environments that generated insights and building intuitive dashboards. During my Master's thesis, I applied reinforcement learning to design an AI agent capable of playing Settlers of Catan in a stochastic environment, deepening my understanding of decision-making under uncertainty.

I hold a **Master's degree in Data Science and Scientific Computing** from the University of Trieste and a **Bachelor's degree in Computer Science** from the University of Udine.

## Current Interests

- **Game Development**: I've always had a passion for creating games. I'd love to work as a content creator in video games or as a data-oriented game programmer. I have experience with Unity and a strong passion for optimization
- **Software Development**: Particularly interested in how LLMs are transforming and accelerating the development process
- **Side Projects**: Currently developing an application that tracks pilgrims along famous routes such as the Camino de Santiago and the Magna Via Francigena, using React, Python, and Redis
- **Pilgrimage Walks**: I love doing long-distance pilgrimage walks like the Magna Via Francigena. These journeys offer time for reflection and connection with history and nature
- **Machine Learning**: Exploring cutting-edge techniques in deep learning and reinforcement learning
- **Chess**: Avid chess player who enjoys strategic thinking and game theory

## What I Do

I specialize in turning complex data into actionable insights. My work combines statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and software engineering to build robust data-driven solutions. I'm passionate about creating interactive visualizations and dashboards that make data accessible to everyone.

My ultimate goal is to combine my passion for data science with my love for video games and app development. I'd love to turn this into a career, working at the intersection of data analytics, game development, and software engineering.

When I'm not working with data, I love programming, especially video games. I enjoy building web applications and exploring new technologies, particularly in the AI/ML space.
