I specialize in machine learning and data visualization to support data-driven decision-making. I’m currently taking some time to deepen my knowledge of game development, as my long-term goal is to apply my data science expertise within the gaming industry.\nBackground My passion for programming began in high school, where I first combined game development with data analysis by creating simple virtual environments. During my Master’s thesis, I applied reinforcement learning to design an AI agent capable of playing Settlers of Catan in a stochastic environment, which strengthened my understanding of decision-making under uncertainty.\nI hold a Master’s degree in Data Science and Scientific Computing from the University of Trieste and a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Udine.\nCurrent Interests Game Development: I’ve always loved building games. I’m particularly interested in content creation and data-oriented game programming. I have experience with Unity and a strong passion for optimization. Software Development: Fascinated by how LLMs are transforming and accelerating the development process. Side Projects: Currently building an application that tracks pilgrims along routes such as the Camino de Santiago and the Magna Via Francigena, using React, Python, and Redis. Pilgrimage Walks: I enjoy long-distance routes like the Magna Via Francigena, which offer time for reflection and a deep connection with history and nature. Machine Learning: Exploring advanced techniques in deep learning and reinforcement learning. Chess: Avid chess player with an interest in strategic thinking and game theory. What I Do I focus on turning complex data into clear, actionable insights. My work blends statistical analysis, machine learning, and software engineering to build reliable data-driven solutions. I’m passionate about creating interactive visualizations and dashboards that make data understandable and accessible.\nMy goal is to combine my expertise in data science with my passion for video games and app development — ideally building a career at the intersection of data analytics, game development, and software engineering.\nI enjoy programming video games and developing web applications, as well as exploring new AI and ML technologies—especially those related to game development.\nGet in Touch Feel free to reach me out at this email: giacomoettore.rocco@gmail.com\n",
