<meta name="description" content="Hi, I&rsquo;m Giacomo Ettore Rocco
I was born in Udine, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy! On April 29, 1995.

Photo taken during my walk along the Magna Via Francigena in Sicilia, here I was in Agrigento
I&rsquo;m a data scientist with strong analytical and problem-solving skills developed in data-intensive environments. I specialize in machine learning and data visualization to support data-driven decision-making.
Background
My passion for programming began in high school, where I combined game development with data analysis — creating virtual environments that generated insights and building intuitive dashboards. During my Master&rsquo;s thesis, I applied reinforcement learning to design an AI agent capable of playing Settlers of Catan in a stochastic environment, deepening my understanding of decision-making under uncertainty.">
