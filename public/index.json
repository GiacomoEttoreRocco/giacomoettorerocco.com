I enjoy building web applications and exploring new technologies, particularly in the AI/ML space.\nGet in Touch Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss data science, machine learning, software development, or potential collaborations!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"hi-im-giacomo-ettore-rocco\"\u003eHi, I\u0026rsquo;m Giacomo Ettore Rocco\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was born in Udine, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy!
